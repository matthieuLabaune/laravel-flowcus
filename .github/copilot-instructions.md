# Laravel + Inertia + Vue Starter Kit - Development Guidelines

This is a modern full-stack web application starter kit built with Laravel and Vue.js, designed for rapid development with GitHub Copilot.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: PHP 8.4, Laravel 12, Inertia.js v2, MySQL, Event-based architecture
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 (Composition API), Shadcn-vue, Tailwind CSS v4, Inertia.js v2, TypeScript
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Task (taskfile.dev), Pest v4 testing framework
- **Analysis**: Laravel Pint, ESLint, PHPStan
- **Design**: Primary color #7c3aed (purple-600)

## Development Workflow

**Essential Commands (Task-based)**:
```bash
task help                    # See all available tasks
task up                      # Start development environment
task down                    # Stop containers
task init                    # First-time setup (env, deps, migrations)
task a -- migrate            # Run artisan commands (task a -- [artisan command])
task composer -- install     # Composer operations
task npm -- run build        # NPM operations
task pint                     # Laravel Pint code formatter
task test                     # Run Pest test suite
```

**Docker Environment**:
- **PHP-FPM**: Main Laravel application
- **Nginx**: Web server at http://localhost
- **Node**: Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173
- **MySQL**: Database server
- **Mailpit**: Email testing at http://localhost:8025
- **Queue/Scheduler**: Background job processing

## Key Application Patterns

**Inertia.js Vue Integration**:
- Pages in `resources/js/pages/` with nested structure
- Shared layouts (`AppLayout.vue`)
- Component library in `resources/js/components/`
- Type-safe props with TypeScript interfaces
- Use `<script setup>` syntax consistently with Composition API

**Form Architecture**:
- Resource controllers with Policy-based authorization
- Form Request classes for validation
- Inertia form handling with `router.post()` and form state management
- Multi-mode forms with proper validation feedback

**Service Layer Architecture**:
- Service-based architecture for external API integrations
- Composable pattern for Vue components
- Graceful fallback when external services are unavailable
- Automatic data formatting and normalization

## Coding Standards & Best Practices

- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - favor clarity over cleverness
- **PHP**: Always use `declare(strict_types=1);`, PHP 8.4 features, Laravel conventions
- **Vue**: Composition API with `<script setup>`, TypeScript interfaces, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Database**: Eloquent models with relationships, scopes, and caching
- **Testing**: Pest framework with Feature and Unit tests, use factories for test data
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support via lang files and `t()` helper in Vue

### Laravel-Specific Patterns

- **Controllers**: Resource controllers with Policy authorization
- **Models**: Eloquent relationships, scopes for filtering, proper type declarations
- **Services**: External API integrations with proper error handling
- **Validation**: Form Request classes, not inline validation
- **Cache**: Intelligent caching for frequently accessed data
- **Queue**: Background processing for time-consuming operations

### Vue/Frontend Patterns
- **Always use shadcn-vue if possible** https://www.shadcn-vue.com/
- **Always use shadcn-vue components if possible** https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/
- **Components**: Single File Components with TypeScript
- **Props**: Define clear interfaces with proper type declarations
- **State**: Reactive refs and computed properties, avoid complex state management
- **API Calls**: Composables for reusable API logic
- **Icons**: Use unified `Icon.vue` component with Lucide icons
- **Forms**: Inertia form helpers with proper error handling

### Performance Guidelines

- Use Eloquent eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
- Implement intelligent caching strategies
- Lazy load images and implement pagination for large datasets
- Optimize Vite build for production deployments

## Testing Philosophy

- **Pest Framework**: Modern PHP testing with descriptive test names
- **Feature Tests**: End-to-end functionality testing via HTTP requests
- **Unit Tests**: Focused testing of individual components/services
- **Browser Tests**: Pest v4 browser testing for UI interactions
- **Factory Pattern**: Use model factories for consistent test data

## Security & Validation

- **Authorization**: Laravel Policies for resource access control
- **Validation**: Form Request classes with comprehensive rules
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Laravel CSRF for all form submissions
- **Input Sanitization**: Proper data validation and sanitization
- **API Rate Limiting**: Throttling for external API calls

## Internationalization

- **Multi-language**: Support for multiple languages (French/English by default)
- **Translation Files**: Organized by feature in `lang/` directory
- **Frontend Integration**: `t()` helper function available in all Vue components
- **Middleware**: `HandleInertiaRequests` shares translations with frontend

## Application Architecture Best Practices

**Model Design**:
- Use proper Eloquent relationships and type declarations
- Implement model scopes for common queries
- Use enums for status fields and content types
- Add appropriate database indexes for performance

**Controller Design**:
- Keep controllers thin, move business logic to services
- Use Form Request classes for validation
- Implement proper authorization with Policies
- Return consistent API responses

**Frontend Component Structure**:
- Create reusable UI components in `resources/js/components/ui/`
- Use composables for shared logic between components
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for props and data
- Follow consistent naming conventions

**Error Handling**:
- Use Laravel's exception handling for backend errors
- Implement user-friendly error messages in the frontend
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide fallback UI states for failed requests

**Code Organization**:
- Group related files together (controllers, requests, policies)
- Use consistent naming conventions across the application
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Document complex business logic

Remember: This starter kit is designed for rapid development of modern web applications. Prioritize user experience, maintainable code, and proper testing coverage while leveraging the full power of Laravel and Vue.js ecosystems.

=== foundation rules ===

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4.11
- inertiajs/inertia-laravel (INERTIA) - v2
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- tightenco/ziggy (ZIGGY) - v2
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v4
- @inertiajs/vue3 (INERTIA) - v2
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4
- vue (VUE) - v3


## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure - don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.


=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain / IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation specific for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The 'search-docs' tool is perfect for all Laravel related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel-ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries - package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit"
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - Words must be adjacent and in that order
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit"
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms


=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use strict typing at the head of a `.php` file: `declare(strict_types=1);`.
- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something _very_ complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- That being said, keys in an Enum should follow existing application Enum conventions.


=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

## Inertia Core

- Inertia.js components should be placed in the `resources/js/Pages` directory unless specified differently in the JS bundler (vite.config.js).
- Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of traditional Blade views.

<code-snippet lang="php" name="Inertia::render Example">
// routes/web.php example
Route::get('/users', function () {
    return Inertia::render('Users/Index', [
        'users' => User::all()
    ]);
});
</code-snippet>


=== inertia-laravel/v2 rules ===

## Inertia v2

- Make use of all Inertia features from v1 & v2. Check the documentation before making any changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.

### Inertia v2 New Features
- Polling
- Prefetching
- Deferred props
- Infinite scrolling using merging props and `WhenVisible`
- Lazy loading data on scroll

### Deferred Props & Empty States
- When using deferred props on the frontend, you should add a nice empty state with pulsing / animated skeleton.


=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] <name>` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.


=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure
- No middleware files in `app/Http/Middleware/`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- **No app\Console\Kernel.php** - use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- **Commands auto-register** - files in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.


=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint` to fix any formatting issues.


=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

### Testing
- If you need to verify a feature is working, write or update a Unit / Feature test.

### Pest Tests
- All tests must be written using Pest. Use `php artisan make:test --pest <name>`.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files - these are core to the application.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- Tests live in the `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit` directories.
- Pest tests look and behave like this:
<code-snippet name="Basic Pest Test Example" lang="php">
it('is true', function () {
    expect(true)->toBeTrue();
});
</code-snippet>

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests using an appropriate filter before finalizing code edits.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).
- When the tests relating to your changes are passing, ask the user if they would like to run the entire test suite to ensure everything is still passing.

### Pest Assertions
- When asserting status codes on a response, use the specific method like `assertForbidden` and `assertNotFound` instead of using `assertStatus(403)` or similar, e.g.:
<code-snippet name="Pest Example Asserting postJson Response" lang="php">
it('returns all', function () {
    $response = $this->postJson('/api/docs', []);

    $response->assertSuccessful();
});
</code-snippet>

### Mocking
- Mocking can be very helpful when appropriate.
- When mocking, you can use the `Pest\Laravel\mock` Pest function, but always import it via `use function Pest\Laravel\mock;` before using it. Alternatively, you can use `$this->mock()` if existing tests do.
- You can also create partial mocks using the same import or self method.

### Datasets
- Use datasets in Pest to simplify tests which have a lot of duplicated data. This is often the case when testing validation rules, so consider going with this solution when writing tests for validation rules.

<code-snippet name="Pest Dataset Example" lang="php">
it('has emails', function (string $email) {
    expect($email)->not->toBeEmpty();
})->with([
    'james' => 'james@laravel.com',
    'taylor' => 'taylor@laravel.com',
]);
</code-snippet>


=== pest/v4 rules ===

## Pest 4

- Pest v4 is a huge upgrade to Pest and offers: browser testing, smoke testing, visual regression testing, test sharding, and faster type coverage.
- Browser testing is incredibly powerful and useful for this project.
- Browser tests should live in `tests/Browser/`.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for detailed guidance on utilizing these features.

### Browser Testing
- You can use Laravel features like `Event::fake()`, `assertAuthenticated()`, and model factories within Pest v4 browser tests, as well as `RefreshDatabase` (when needed) to ensure a clean state for each test.
- Interact with the page (click, type, scroll, select, submit, drag-and-drop, touch gestures, etc.) when appropriate to complete the test.
- If requested, test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- If requested, test on different devices and viewports (like iPhone 14 Pro, tablets, or custom breakpoints).
- Switch color schemes (light/dark mode) when appropriate.
- Take screenshots or pause tests for debugging when appropriate.

### Example Tests

<code-snippet name="Pest Browser Test Example" lang="php">
it('may reset the password', function () {
    Notification::fake();

    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create());

    $page = visit('/sign-in'); // Visit on a real browser...

    $page->assertSee('Sign In')
        ->assertNoJavascriptErrors() // or ->assertNoConsoleLogs()
        ->click('Forgot Password?')
        ->fill('email', 'nuno@laravel.com')
        ->click('Send Reset Link')
        ->assertSee('We have emailed your password reset link!')

    Notification::assertSent(ResetPassword::class);
});
</code-snippet>



<code-snippet name="Pest Smoke Testing Example" lang="php">
$pages = visit(['/', '/about', '/contact']);

$pages->assertNoJavascriptErrors()->assertNoConsoleLogs();
</code-snippet>


=== inertia-vue/core rules ===

## Inertia + Vue

- Vue components must have a single root element.
- Use `router.visit()` or `<Link>` for navigation instead of traditional links.

<code-snippet lang="vue" name="Inertia Client Navigation">
    import { Link } from '@inertiajs/vue3'

    <Link href="/">Home</Link>
</code-snippet>

- For form handling, use `router.post` and related methods. Do not use regular forms.


<code-snippet lang="vue" name="Inertia Vue Form Example">
    <script setup>
    import { reactive } from 'vue'
    import { router } from '@inertiajs/vue3'
    import { usePage } from '@inertiajs/vue3'

    const page = usePage()

    const form = reactive({
      first_name: null,
      last_name: null,
      email: null,
    })

    function submit() {
      router.post('/users', form)
    }
    </script>

    <template>
        <h1>Create {{ page.modelName }}</h1>
        <form @submit.prevent="submit">
            <label for="first_name">First name:</label>
            <input id="first_name" v-model="form.first_name" />
            <label for="last_name">Last name:</label>
            <input id="last_name" v-model="form.last_name" />
            <label for="email">Email:</label>
            <input id="email" v-model="form.email" />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    </template>
</code-snippet>


=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

## Tailwind Core

- Use Tailwind CSS classes to style HTML, check and use existing tailwind conventions within the project before writing your own.
- Offer to extract repeated patterns into components that match the project's conventions (i.e. Blade, JSX, Vue, etc..)
- Think through class placement, order, priority, and defaults - remove redundant classes, add classes to parent or child carefully to limit repetition, group elements logically
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get exact examples from the official documentation when needed.

### Spacing
- When listing items, use gap utilities for spacing, don't use margins.

    <code-snippet name="Valid Flex Gap Spacing Example" lang="html">
        <div class="flex gap-8">
            <div>Superior</div>
            <div>Michigan</div>
            <div>Erie</div>
        </div>
    </code-snippet>


### Dark Mode
- If existing pages and components support dark mode, new pages and components must support dark mode in a similar way, typically using `dark:`.


=== tailwindcss/v4 rules ===

## Tailwind 4

- Always use Tailwind CSS v4 - do not use the deprecated utilities.
- `corePlugins` is not supported in Tailwind v4.
- In Tailwind v4, you import Tailwind using a regular CSS `@import` statement, not using the `@tailwind` directives used in v3:

<code-snippet name="Tailwind v4 Import Tailwind Diff" lang="diff"
   - @tailwind base;
   - @tailwind components;
   - @tailwind utilities;
   + @import "tailwindcss";
</code-snippet>


### Replaced Utilities
- Tailwind v4 removed deprecated utilities. Do not use the deprecated option - use the replacement.
- Opacity values are still numeric.

| Deprecated |	Replacement |
|------------+--------------|
| bg-opacity-* | bg-black/* |
| text-opacity-* | text-black/* |
| border-opacity-* | border-black/* |
| divide-opacity-* | divide-black/* |
| ring-opacity-* | ring-black/* |
| placeholder-opacity-* | placeholder-black/* |
| flex-shrink-* | shrink-* |
| flex-grow-* | grow-* |
| overflow-ellipsis | text-ellipsis |
| decoration-slice | box-decoration-slice |
| decoration-clone | box-decoration-clone |


=== tests rules ===

## Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test` with a specific filename or filter.


=== .ai/pomodoro-design rules ===

<h2>Pomodoro Domain Design</h2>
<p>The Pomodoro domain centers around Users running timed focus sessions (PomodoroSessions) optionally attached to Tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Principles:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Single active focus session per user at any time.</li>
	<li>Break sessions (short/long) are persisted for analytics symmetry.</li>
	<li>Historical sessions immutable; corrections create new sessions.</li>
	<li>Enums: TaskStatus (pending, in_progress, done); SessionType (focus, short_break, long_break).</li>
	<li>Daily summaries aggregate only <code>SessionType::Focus</code> actual_seconds.</li>
	<li>Planned vs actual kept for velocity metrics.</li>
	<li>Interruptions_count increments via explicit interrupt action only.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Validation (initial draft):</strong></p>
<pre>
start: task_id nullable|exists:tasks,id (must belong to user); planned_seconds integer 60..7200
finish: session must be running; ended_at set server-side; actual_seconds derived
interrupt: only allowed while running; increments interruptions_count
</pre>
<p>Return concise JSON; derive progress percentage client-side. Avoid overfetching: sessions list paginated, single active session pushed via polling or later websockets.</p>
</laravel-boost-guidelines>
